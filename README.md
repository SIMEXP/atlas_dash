# atlas_dash
Building a dashboard for the multiscale atlas.

Goals are:
1. Interactive volumetric viewer for scale 7 and a user selected scale based on brainsprite
2. Circular connectivity plot with edge bundling that is highlighted based on the selected network in the volumetric viewer
3. User feedback option for the network labels
